Ian's Sublime Text Settings
---------------------------

This repository contains the settings that I use for Sublime Text 3. These are
the settings that work best for me and you are welcome to make use of them.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started using these settings, clone the repository into the your User
configuration directory. Depending on your OS the default Sublime Configuration
may be located someplace else. Below are the defaults paths for Linux and Mac.

    # Linux
    $ DIR="$HOME/.config/sublime-text-settings/User"

    # Mac OS X
    $ DIR="$HOME/.config/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"

    $ git clone https://github.com/IanLee1521/Sublime-Text-Settings $DIR
